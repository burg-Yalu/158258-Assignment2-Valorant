Leading him to a specialized facility known as The Vault in the far northern archipelago of Svalbard, Sova arrived to find no activity there, no signs of life, except for a faint beacon activated from within. Entering The Vault, the Russian eventually made his way to a containment room to discover the aftermath of an attack, with all the pickup team dead except for one remaining survivor - a blonde-haired woman with one of her arms completely obliterated. The woman, named Iselin, had been one of three elite hunters from the security force Ståljeger who had been assigned to escort a Project Landfall scientist to The Vault and oversee the extraction and transport of a very special item; a radivore that had mimicked the form of a bear. Her team had also arrived at The Vault to find it empty and with hardly any power left, and on entering Containment they had discovered the radivore had broken out of its enclosure, right before it then attacked them, killing her fellow Ståljeger comrades and the Landfall scientist in quick succession. With one nearby chamber still operational, Iselin was able to lure the radivore into it. As she attempted to confine it within though whilst the chamber powered up, the bear forced its head between the closing doors, biting down onto her left arm and holding it in its jaws. From that bite, substances from the radivore\'s body entered Iselin\'s own system, causing her to become disoriented and hear an echoing voice, before the sound of a gunshot broke her out of her state of delirium. The scientist, in his final living moment while dying on the ground, had fired a shot at the radivore before collapsing. With the chamber now fully powered up, Iselin activated it to produce a surge of energy that filled the chamber and burst through the gap between the doors, obliterating both the radivore and the arm trapped in its jaws. The ordeal now over, Iselin slowly made her way over the the body of the fallen scientist, picked up a dropped beacon nearby, and activated it moments before finally collapsing.

As he was a double congenital amputee however, the judge was pitiful and lenient towards him, giving him a smaller sentence that soon allowed Erik to return to his old ways. Building himself his own mechanical arms to use, Erik would hit back with his own criminal assignments, becoming so notorious for the terrible things he had done that he eventually had to go into hiding and effectively exile himself from his home. During these times, he also encountered the young Brazilian Tayane Alves, who worked alongside him for a while and provided some major upgrades to his arms, resulting in the carbon-steel titanium-plating version that he uses to this day. Later approached to become a VALORANT agent, Torsten accepted the offer though his induction was not a smooth affair. Leaving behind his criminal life in line with VP procedure, his records were sealed and he became the Protocol\'s thirteenth agent, "Breach". Despite now serving for the secret organization with more dignified actions however, the consequences of his criminal past forever remain, leaving him a man that, for all he does now, can still never truly return home.';

Using her ability to see nightmare-visions, her interpretations initially led her to suspect that he had been kidnapped by a secret organization she found to be the VALORANT Protocol. Eyletmez decided to contact the Protocol under an anonymous mark, threatening to expose the organization if she found out they were responsible for the kidnapping. When they appeared to only have interest in tracking her down rather than take her seriously, she then contacted each agent personally with a dossier about them to show how much she knew about VALORANT\'s people and what she could expose to the public if they had no interest in proving their innocence. VALORANT however still refused to give in and soon sent a strike team to Istanbul to apprehend her. Eyletmez attempted to use her Radiant powers to distract them and flee undetected but was spotted just as she was making her escape, allowing the Anti-Yield robot KAY/O to jump on her position and take her down with a suppressing pulse. Subsequently detained and taken to a VP base, Eyletmez was interrogated there by senior agents. However, it was because of these direct, face-to-face meetings that a critical piece of information came to light - VALORANT had no idea who she was trying to track down and knew nothing of any kidnapping. Whoever was responsible for the man\'s disappearance, it wasn\'t the VALORANT Protocol. It was after this revelation that Eyletmez also came to learn about the existence of other worlds and it was suggested to her that maybe her unknown group came from one of these worlds instead. VALORANT themselves were already preparing to travel to one, having had to put that project on hold in order to deal with Eyletmez. Their search had also exposed how reliant the Protocol was on specific agents for information, and they were looking to recruit more as a result. With there being no more reason for the two to be enemies, VALORANT\'s senior agents decided to ask if she would join the organization and help them gather information during their trip to Omega Earth. Choosing to put this misunderstanding behind her, Eyletmez accepted their offer to become their twentieth agent, "Fade". She now carries the banner of the VALORANT Protocol - but only as long as it brings her closer to the person she seeks.';
